    For windows users we added a neat feature for you to open your configuration file using the -c file. It will open notepad. No more struggling to look for your configuration!

    Timer Implementation has been shipped and now you are able to use the application as a basic study timer!
    I am yet to add the ability of the clock to ping, send a notification or ring when the timer has ended!
    A new help page has been created with the help with AI, allowing you to fully understand the utility. 
    I am yet to test the clock more on Windows and Linux.
